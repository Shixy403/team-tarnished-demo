# Flash Forward by Team Tarnished – Top-Down Bullet Hell Game (C)

Developed as part of a game programming project at DigiPen Institute of Technology.  
This repository showcases my personal contributions to the project, focused on gameplay systems and level logic.

## Overview
Team Tarnished is a 2D action game built using **modular C programming**, where gameplay systems are organized into dedicated modules for readability and maintainability.  
My focus was implementing gameplay mechanics, projectile logic, and level scripting.

## My Contributions
- Implemented `bullet.c` and `bullet.h` for projectile creation, updates, and rendering.  
- Designed player damage, invulnerability, and collision detection systems.  
- Adjusted and refined gameplay elements in `levelTwo.c`, including traps and enemy speeds.  
- Cleaned up warnings, optimized performance, and documented core gameplay modules.  

## Technologies Used
- C Programming  
- Visual Studio  
- Git for version control
